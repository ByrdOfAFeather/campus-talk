      "content": "The ship was first spotted as it streaked across the Detroit skyline and landed. On orders from Ultra Magnus, Sentinel Prime activated the ship's forcefield to quarantine it against the organics of Earth. However as Cybertronian technology its forcefield was no match for Sari Sumdac's AllSpark Key, which permitted the tiny organic to enter and scare the bajoobies out of Jazz. The Elite Guard\n\nAfter the revelation that Detroit was host to numerous scattered AllSpark fragments, Ultra Magnus stayed on board, ready to report any \"supposed\" Decepticon activity directly to Cybertron Command. Optimus and Sentinel reported to Magnus about the reported Decepticon activity, which itself was a trick by the Headmaster to get Sentinel's body, though Optimus stretched the truth on his behalf. The Return of the Headmaster Soon Magnus received a report from his agent Ironhide who was stationed on the rim of the galaxy. Ironhide, while under heavy fire, informed Magnus that the Decepticons were growing bolder and attacking remote Autobot colonies and space bridges. Magnus made preparations for the ship to leave Earth. The ship's forcefields were shown not to penetrate below the ground, which allowed the cloaked Decepticons to tunnel beneath it and steal the ship's subspace transmitter. After finding out that Optimus was telling the truth about the Decepticons, the Elite Guard flew the ship back to Cybertron to defend it from the 'Cons. Mission Accomplished\n\nOn its way back to Cybertron, the Decepticon captive Starscream broke out of the vessel and headed back for Earth. Due to the theft of the transmitter, the Elite Guard were unable to contact the Autobots on Earth about it until they landed on Cybertron. A Fistful of Energon\n\nSentinel, Jazz, Jetfire, and Jetstorm took the Steelhaven to Earth in pursuit of the fugitive Wasp. Where Is Thy Sting? While on Earth, the Autobots began incarcerating several of Megatron's lieutenants that Sentinel had hired Lockdown to round up. The crew learned of the attack on Ultra Magnus, Five Servos of Doom and when Wasp had been dealt with, Sentinel departed Earth to head back to Cybertron. Predacons Rising Thanks to Sentinel steering the ship through an energy cloud in his haste to get home, Swindle was revived and freed the other prisoners. Lugnut led an uprising against the Elite Guard, and Sentinel was only just able to signal Optimus for help before getting captured. Optimus was sent aboard the ship and the ensuing battle spilled out into space once Lugnut poked a hole in the Steelhaven. While Lugnut was lost in space, Blitzwing, Sunstorm, and Ramjet were recaptured by Optimus and Jazz. As thanks for his help, Sentinel took the Steelhaven back to Earth to drop off Optimus before returning to Cybertron. Decepticon Air\n\nNotes",

      "content": "Millions of years ago, Omega Supreme was a member of the legendary Guardian robots, and was charged with defending Crystal City, the most spectacular city on Cybertron. He befriended the Constructicons, the city's creators. However, as it would happen, the Constructicons were attacked by Megatron's Robosmasher and converted into Decepticons. The now-evil Constructicons convinced Omega to leave his post to help defend the capital city, and promised to look after the city in his stead. When he left, they demolished the Crystal City, to Omega Supreme's horror. He hunted them down, trapping them in a pit, and tried to reverse the reprogramming done by the Robo-Smasher. Though he appeared to be successful, the programming was irreversible, and Megatron had given the Constructicons a new combined form named Devastator. The treacherous Constructicons lured Omega into an ambush and in their new form attempted to use the Smasher to convert him into a Decepticon, but he destroyed the machine and they fled before he recovered from the attack.\n\nI lived, but changed. Since then, I feel only hate for the Constructicons.\n(thumbnail)\n\nEt tu, Robo-Smasher?\nSome time after these events transpired—after the launch of the Autobot and Decepticon starships—the Constructicons left Cybertron in a starship and tried to locate the missing Megatron. Omega Supreme pursued them, \"for millions of years, across the galaxies\"; eventually, the Constructicons rejoined Megatron on Earth, and Omega Supreme followed them there, still seeking revenge. The Secret of Omega Supreme\n\n(thumbnail)\n\nA shuttle in the hand is worth two on the track.\nFor the most part, he acted as inter-planetary transport for the Autobots, as well as their last line of defense. While he was preparing for a round of target practice, Omega lost contact with Optimus Prime when Blaster began broadcasting the music from a concert over the Autobot communications frequencies. The interference resulted in Megatron getting away clean with the Voltronic Galaxer, which necessitated a trip to the Moon to retrieve it. Omega took Optimus, Powerglide, Spike Witwicky and Carly. There, he got to battle Astrotrain, who taunted him for being outdated technology, but changed his tune after Omega triumphed. Blaster Blues When the Decepticons found a pool of electrum, rendering them invulnerable, they attacked Omega Supreme. His weapons had no effect on them, and the titan fell. Later the Autobots got the opportunity for payback when they located the electrum pool and used it themselves, gaining the advantage as the Decepticons' electrum coating wore off. The Golden Lagoon\n\nAfter Cosmos crashed on Titan, Omega carried Perceptor and Jazz there on a rescue mission. Unfortunately he just barely had enough energy to land, and was left teetering on the edge of a cliff overhanging a lake of deadly liquid. The moon was fortunately rich in energy crystals, and Perceptor was able to use them to repower Omega. The explosion of the crystal deposit caused the island they were on to begin to disintegrate, so Omega Supreme used his base mode to transport everyone across to safety. The God Gambit\n\n(thumbnail)\n\nStorytime: informative.\nOmega Surpreme finally got his chance at revenge when the Constructicons started mining an asteroid that turned out to be the egg of an strange creature. Omega left the creature to its own devices, which would have resulted in it devouring San Francisco. However, Optimus Prime convinced Omega to lead the creature back to its asteroid, which would sustain it. Omega lost his chance at revenge, but he did his duty. The Secret of Omega Supreme\n\nAfter the energy pest Kremzeek took out most of the Autobots, Omega Supreme transported the survivors of his attack to Japan in an attempt to track down the creature. When they arrived, they were immediately beset by Kremzeek, however the Autobots remembered that Omega had not been coated with the insulating compound that was protecting them. Omega took to the air, but Kremzeek managed to reach him anyway, and he quickly crashed onto the Japanese beach. Bumblebee promised they'd fix him up as soon as possible. Kremzeek!\n\nThe Autobots used Omega Supreme to follow the Decepticons back to Cybertron when Megatron intended to use Vector Sigma to create a new group of Decepticon warriors. After failing to stop the Decepticons from creating the Stunticons, The Key to Vector Sigma, Part 1 the Autobots created a new team of their own to counter the new threat, the Aerialbots. As Omega Supreme escaped Cybertron, he was hit by weapons fire from the Centurion droids, and once he safely disembarked his passengers on Earth, he catastrophically exploded.\n\n(thumbnail)\n\nExploding: painful.\nRatchet, Wheeljack and Sparkplug Witwicky connected Omega Supreme's mind to the Ark's life support unit while they set about putting the giant back together. The arrogant Aerialbots, unimpressed with both the Autobots and the humans they protected, refused to help their comrades in defeating the Decepticons until their group leader Silverbolt showed them how Sparkplug was able to disregard his fatigue and continue repairing Omega Supreme simply because of his concern for a friend's well being. Soon afterwards, the Aerialbots were facing defeat as Superion at the hands of the Stunticon combined form, Menasor, when the newly repaired Omega Supreme suddenly appeared and helped them defeat the combiner and send the Decepticons packing. The Key to Vector Sigma, Part 2\n\n(thumbnail)\n\nEnemy fire: tickles.\nHe transported the Autobots and the Aerialbots back to Cybertron when they detected strange energy readings emanating from the planet. The trip expended his energy so he was forced to sit out the mission. While the Autobots dealt with a time machine sending the Aerialbots to the past, the Decepticons reactivated one of Omega's fellow Guardian Robots. After the Aerialbots returned from their trip through time, Silverbolt handed over some power packs they had taken from the Cybertron's Golden Age to refuel Omega. War Dawn\n\nAfter the coming of Unicron, his space transport role was fulfilled by Sky Lynx, though he still carried out occasional missions. He transported several Autobots to Junkion to investigate the strange behaviour of the Junkions. He was shot down by Cyclonus, Scourge and the Sweeps crashing the Autobots on an asteroid. After being repaired Omega quickly turned the tide of the battle. Upon arriving on Junkion, Omega again battled the Decepticons.
